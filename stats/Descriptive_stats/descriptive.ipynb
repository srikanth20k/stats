This tool presents precise and simple-to-understand summaries and observations of the sample using measures like **mean, median, variance as well as graphs and charts**. Apart from this, univariate descriptive statistics which is a subcategory of descriptive statistics is used to describe data containing only one variable while bivariate and multivariate statistics are used to describe data with multiple variables.\n",
